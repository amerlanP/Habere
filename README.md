## What does your application do?
This application is a habit tracker that allows users to pick from a list of habits that they want to break/create (track). They can accumulate points by doing the tasks they set for themselves and can see a leaderboard with their friends/global. Each different habit carries a different predetermined point weight.

## Unique touch
To make our project unique compared to existing habit trackers in the market, we are going to introduce the following features:
1) Habit streaks with friends that users can have accountability partners.
2) To expand on the first feature, we are also going to implement habit streaks for groups of friends.
3) Habit suggestions when a user first starts using the web app and when they finish a habit they defined. 


## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?
The ability to connect and compete with friends introduces a game-like environment that makes it more than just a CRUD app. We will also explore interfacing with chatGPT to make custom habits and weigh them appropriately.

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
The app will contain somewhat sensitive infromation about the users like phone numbers, passwords, emails, etc. So this information will have to be kept secure/encrypted. Since there is also a competitive aspect to this app, preventing cheating is important to maintain the competitive integrity of the app.
